# Balancer - A Simpler way to Organize
Balancer is a personal project management tool that emphasizes simplicity above all else. You can create projects, assign tasks to those projects, and view them on a kanban board. Taking inspiration from the software development industry, this tool aims to combine Agile principles with the simple to-do list to boost your productivity. Less is more!
## Recurring vs One Time Tasks
Commonly used tools for project management fail to emphasize the importance of repeated tasks, this app ensures they get their own board where division is not by backlogs and in progress columns, but by what day they need to be completed.
## The Stack
The app is built with the Next.js framework utilizing TypeScript. The future database will be MongoDB.
## Running the App
npm run dev
